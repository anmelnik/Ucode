    <h2>What makes a superhero?</h2>
    <p>Asuperhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. 
        So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess,</b>
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. 
        But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. 
        If the good guy is doing something that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.</p>

        <h2>My favorit superhero</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/t00.png" alt="picter"/>
        <p>Deadpool</p>
        <p>Deadpool is depicted as having an accelerated healing factor,
            which not only prevents him from being permanently injured through enhanced cell regeneration throughout his body,
            but also causes psychosis and mental instability, as his neurons are also affected by the accelerated regeneration.
            It is thought that while his psychoses are a handicap, they are also one of his assets as they make him an extremely unpredictable opponent.
            Taskmaster, who has photo-reflexive memory which allows him to copy anyone's fighting skills by observation,
            was unable to defeat Deadpool due to his chaotic and improvised fighting style.
            Taskmaster has also stated that Deadpool is an expert at distracting his opponents.
