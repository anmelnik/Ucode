    <p>Search engines evaluate the quality and relevance of articles by the words and phrases contained in it (collocations). The more thematic key phrases in the text, the more chances that it will receive a high rating.

        Accordingly, if there are few key words in the text, but a lot of "water" - stop words, inserted words, template phrases, the quality of the article will be lower.
        
        But too many keywords is also bad, such a document will be marked "overspam" and is unlikely to be shown in search results.
